## Destiny inspired UI Experiment

When I used to play [Destiny](https://www.destinythegame.com/uk/en/home), I got inspired by their menus and decided to make UI concept based on this

<script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/flickity/1.1.1/flickity.pkgd.min.js"></script>
<div class="sandbox ui-experiment">{% include ui-experiment/main.html %}</div>
