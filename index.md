## Intro

This is a static jekyll site built with a very simple theme and as such uses markdown to generate the pages! There are no libraries, just some clever JS and SCSS. Here's the [github source](https://github.com/lopeax/lopeax.github.io) if you so wish to see how it's been built

This design is inspired by [material design](https://material.io/guidelines/)

Also supports all latest browsers, but chrome has the best experience!
