## A small intro

I'm a web developer situated in Oxford, having started with WordPress sites I started with PHP and JavaScript in the beginning, but I've lately moved onto developing applications using the PHP framework [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) which feels oh so much better!

I'm also a gamer, and sometimes that's reflected in the methods I use in my development, and the focal point of some of my personal projects :) (Looking at you [parody lyrics](/parody-lyrics/17-explosions-in-a-row)!)

## About the site

This is a static jekyll site built with a very simple theme and as such uses markdown (and as such could potentially be used to generate documentation pages) to generate the pages! There are no libraries, just some clever JS and SCSS. Here's the [github source](https://github.com/lopeax/lopeax.github.io) if you so wish to see how it's been built

This design is inspired by [material design](https://material.io/guidelines/)

Also *should* support all latest browsers, but chrome has the best experience! If you find any issues, please raise them in an [issue](https://github.com/zeraphie/zeraphie.github.io/issues)
